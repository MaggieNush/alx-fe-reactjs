            <p style={{ color: '#A0522D', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
                Founded with a passion for unique aromas and beautiful design, Sweet Scents Candles started in a small home kitchen. We believe in creating candles that not only smell incredible but also look good enough to eat (but please don't!).
            </p>
            <p style={{ color: '#A0522D', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
                Our mission is to bring joy and comfort to your space with our artisan dessert candles. We use only high-quality, eco-friendly soy wax and premium fragrance oils to ensure a clean, long-lasting, and delightful burn.
            </p>
            <p style={{ color: '#A0522D', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
                Every candle is hand-poured with love, attention to detail, and a dash of sweet inspiration.
